Q2.  Consider following Version2 of Code Snippet:  

Sub main()

Dim x As Single
Dim i As Integer

x = 0
i = 1

x = x + i + 1;

For i = 1 To 10
    x = x + 10
Next i

If x > 1 Then
    print(x)
End If

End Sub


Design Lexical Analysis, Syntax Analysis, Intermediate Code Generation and Code Generation part of compiler based on the version2 of code snippet.
